# Gallery Manager Project

---

_A group project done for a school course (not meant to be duplicated)_ 

## Description: 
The purpose of the Gallery Manager is to provide the ability for gallery owners
and art piece owners to keep track of the whereabouts of art pieces. 
Users are able to track different galleries, current exhibitions and
which art works are currently on display. The database will also keep
track of visitors and which art pieces they have visited, so if an accident
occurs and an art piece is damages, owners are able to narrow down the list of
places it has been and visitors who have recently seen it. An additional
feature of the database is the ability to keep track of buildings and rooms
where exhibitions can be held, so if an art piece requires specific room
conditions (lighting, temperature, size, etc), the database will be
able to find a suitable room.

There are also certain parts
of the original files I've omitted from this public repo because
of private information - but the full site is accessible here:
